# About Me
My name is Karolina Trawi≈Ñska. By education I am a master of pharmacy. In my current job, among other things, I am responsible for
professional customer service, ensuring compliance with the Pharmaceutical Law and keeping an eye on
the stock of the pharmacy. My superiors appreciate me for my commitment, meticulousness and ability to
work as a team. I am currently looking for development opportunities in the IT sector. I am gradually
improving my qualifications by attending courses and learning from books and materials available on the
Internet. I am eager to learn about new solutions and technologies.
